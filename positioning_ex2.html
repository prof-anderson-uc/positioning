		<section class="inner">
			<p>This exercise will demonstrate contextual positioning. There are two <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements, one nested inside the other. The outer section has a red border. The inner section has a grey background color.</p>

			<p>When the inner <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is given absolute positioning, it positions itself relative to the default positioning context, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> but you can change that by making its parent element relative.</p>
